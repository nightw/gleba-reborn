# Overview

This mod reworks Gleba's mechanics, making the technology more useful and improving the planet's balance when compared to Vulcanus and Fulgora.

# Changes

Each of these changes can be disabled in the mod settings. (Main Menu > Settings > Mod Settings)

#### Biochamber Rework

- **Additional Crafting Recipes:** Makes biochambers useful for more than just rocket fuel by adding additional recipes, including uranium processing and kovarex enrichment.
- **New Bacteria Recipes:** Biochambers can convert iron and copper bacteria directly into plates, or combine bacteria with bioflux to produce steel or green circuits. To support these recipes iron and copper bacteria now last longer before spoiling, and turn into spoilage instead of ore.
- **Simpler Requirements:** The biochamber is crafted using jelly and yumako mash instead of nutrients and pentapod eggs. Pentapod egg production isn't required until later, after the player is familiar with handling non-hostile spoilage.

#### Wood and Fish Farming Rework

- **Quicker Unlock:** Tree seeding and fish breeding are now unlocked by crafting seeds after unlocking the agricultural tower.
- **Nutrient Production:** Fish breeding now consumes tree seeds instead of nutrients, which allows breeding fish to produce nutrients to power your biochambers and biolabs.

#### Enemy Balance

- **Less Early Pentapods:** Strafer and stomper spawn rates are reduced when you first arrive on gleba, and slowly return to normal by the time medium pentapods begin spawning. An optional setting allows you to permanently reduce strafer and stomper spawn rates.

#### Biolab Rework

- **Hungry Biolabs:** Biolabs now consume nutrients instead of electricity, giving an additional use for nutrients produced by tree and fish farms. (Like all of these changes, this can be disabled in the mod settings)

#### Optional Settings

- **Change or Disable Spoilage for Individual Items:** In the mod settings you can choose the separate spoilage times for nutrients, bacteria, and agricultural science packs, or make them never spoil.

# Using an Existing Save

Enabling **Recipe Compatibility Mode** in the mod settings (Main Menu > Settings > Mod Settings) will keep the vanilla biochamber and fish breeding recipes enabled in addition to the newly changed recipes.

If you play an existing Gleba save file without enabling recipe compatibility mode, you will need to update any of your machines that are crafting biochambers or fish breeding to give them the new ingredients.

# But Why?

#### Gleba resource production is slow to start up

Vulcanus and Fulgora both have new solutions to produce basic materials without having to mine and smelt ore. On Gleba, however, you must set up bacteria and bioflux production just to produce raw ore to process.

This mod eliminates the need for smelting ore, accelerating you through the parts of the tech tree you've already solved on Nauvis and allowing you to quickly move on to producing more interesting products.

#### Gleba's rewards come too late

When you arrive on Vulcanus or Fulgora, you are almost immediately rewarded with the smelter and recycler, and these can be shipped out for use on other planets. The biochamber can't be used on other planets until you are able to ship out bioflux to turn into nutrients onsite, and it's only useful for oil cracking and producing rocket fuel.

This mod adds nutrient production via tree and fish farming so that you can make use of your new biochambers right away, and also expands the number of recipes that biochambers can craft to make them more rewarding to acquire.
